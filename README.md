# wil_ace_cpr
When using the ACE advanced medical system in combination with the revive system, some players won't be able to get revived without a PAK. This small mod changes the behavior of the CPR function in such a way, that as long as the player has a certain blood volume, he can get revived.

See https://github.com/acemod/ACE3/issues/2728 for more details.
